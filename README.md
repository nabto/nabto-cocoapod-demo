# Nabto Cocoapod Demo

Simplest possible example of an app and XCode unit tests that use the [NabtoClient Cocoapod](http://cocoapods.org/pods/NabtoClient).

First, if you have not install Cocoapods, do so: `sudo gem install cocoapods`

Next, run `pod install`.

Open `NabtoCocoapodDemo.xcworkspace` and run the app or unit tests. The app is a tad simple, observe the debug console in XCode for any interesting output.
